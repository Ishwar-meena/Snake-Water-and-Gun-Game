# Snake Water and Gun Game
I have created Snake Water and Gun Game using c++.

It's take input from user and also choose a random number by computer. 

It's a basic game like a rock paper scissors game.

It's  show which option user choose and which option choose a bot.

It's also show points every time for user and bot.

Game conditions are ----
In the Snake Water Gun game, the conditions for winning are as follows:

1.Snake drinks water, so if the user chooses snake and the computer chooses water, the user wins.

2.Gun shoots the snake, so if the user chooses gun and the computer chooses snake, the user wins.

3.Water destroys the gun, so if the user chooses water and the computer chooses gun, the user wins.

If both the user and computer choose the same option, it's a tie. Otherwise, the computer wins.
